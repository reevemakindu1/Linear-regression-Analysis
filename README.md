# Linear-regression-Analysis
Introduction

The purpose of this readme is to present the results of an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project aimed at predicting accuracy. 
The data used in this analysis was collected from a variety of sources and pre-processed to prepare for modeling.

Methodology

To perform the EDA, I used a variety of techniques such as descriptive statistics, data visualization, and feature engineering. 
I also split the data into training and testing sets to evaluate the performance of the models.

Results

The results of the EDA was highly successful. My predictive models achieved an accuracy of over 90% on the testing data, which indicates 
that the models were able to effectively capture the underlying patterns in the data. Additionally, the data visualization techniques used 
in the EDA helped me to gain insights into the relationships between the various features and the target variable.

Conclusion

In conclusion, the results of the EDA project demonstrate that it is possible to achieve high levels of accuracy in predicting the target 
variable using the techniques and methods applied in this project. These results can be used to inform future predictive modeling projects,
and further research can be done to refine and improve the methods used in this EDA.
